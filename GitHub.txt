GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that provides a web-based graphical interface. It is the worldâ€™s largest coding community. Putting a code or a project into GitHub brings it increased, widespread exposure. Programmers can find source codes in many different languages and use the command-line interface, Git, to make and keep track of any changes.
