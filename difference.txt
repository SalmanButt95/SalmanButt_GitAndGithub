Git is a version control system that is used to track changes made to a codebase over time. It allows developers to create and manage different versions of their code, collaborate with other developers, and revert changes if necessary. Git is a command-line tool that can be used locally on a developer's computer.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides a graphical interface for managing Git repositories. It offers features such as issue tracking, project management, and collaboration tools that make it easier for developers to work together on a project. GitHub also allows users to host their Git repositories on the cloud and collaborate with other developers in a more streamlined way.
