Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.
Simply put, Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them. 
Distributed architecture: Git operates as a distributed system, meaning that each developer has their own copy of the codebase on their local machine. This allows for greater flexibility in terms of working offline and enables developers to easily share changes with others.
Branching and merging: Git allows developers to create multiple branches of their codebase, each with its own set of changes. These branches can be merged back into the main codebase once the changes have been reviewed and approved.
Commit history: Git maintains a detailed history of all changes made to the codebase, making it easy to track down bugs and roll back changes if necessary.
Staging area: Git provides a staging area where developers can review and select which changes they want to include in their next commit. This helps to ensure that only relevant changes are included in each commit.
